# Land-Stewardship
This repository will be used to catalog, journal, document and preserve my journey as I reclaim my birthright of land stewardship.

What am I currently up to?

I am looking at connecting the following resources // 
- The mission Continues (Veteran Service Organization)
- Duwamish Longhouse
