# Land-Stewardship
This repository will be used to catalog, journal, document and preserve my journey as I weave threads to restore matrilineal governance in the PNW

User Story:

As an indigenous person I should be in right relationship with the land, waters, plants animals, seasons and my fellow humxns. 
As a resident of the Pacific Northwest I want to cultivate a culture of land stewardship as I see it lacking attention and intention accross my communities.
I intend to listen, lead and be led, inspire, tend and model behavior.
I require critique in my efforts from indigenous elders.

What am I currently up to?

- The mission Continues (Veteran Service Organization)
- Heron's Nest
